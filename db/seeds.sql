INSERT INTO exercies (exercise_name, exercise_discription, muscle_group) VALUES("Bench Press","Lay down on a bench, the bar should be directly above your eyes, the knees are somewhat angled and the feet are firmly on the floor. Concentrate, breath deeply and grab the bar more than shoulder wide. Bring it slowly down till it briefly touches your chest at the height of your nipples. Push the bar up.","chest");
INSERT INTO exercies (exercise_name, exercise_discription, muscle_group) VALUES("Push Up","Lie on the floor face down and place your hands about 36 inches apart while holding your torso up at arms length. Next, lower yourself downward until your chest almost touches the floor as you inhale. Now breathe out and press your upper body back up to the starting position while squeezing your chest. After a brief pause at the top contracted position, you can begin to lower yourself downward again for as many repetitions as needed.","chest");
INSERT INTO exercies (exercise_name, exercise_discription, muscle_group) VALUES("Dumbbell Flyes","Take two dumbbells and lay on a bench, make sure the feet are firmly on the ground and your back is not arched, but has good contact with the bench. The arms are stretched in front of you, about shoulder wide. Bend now the arms a bit and let them down with a half-circle movement to the side. Without changing the angle of the elbow bring them in a fluid movement back up.","chest");
INSERT INTO exercies (exercise_name, exercise_discription, muscle_group) VALUES("Incline Dumbbell Press","The movement is very similar to benchpressing with a barbell, however, the weight is brought down to the chest at a lower point. Hold two dumbbells and lay down on a bench. Hold the weights next to the chest, at the height of your nipples and press them up till the arms are stretched. Let the weight slowly and controlled down.","chest");

Take a step forward so that one foot is in front of the other, for stability, and so that there is tension on the cables. Bring hands together in front of you. Try to make your hands overlap (so that the cables cross) a few inches.","chest");

INSERT INTO exercies (exercise_name, exercise_discription, muscle_group) VALUES("Bent Over Row","Back excercise with a barbell with a starting position which is in a bent over position with the back paralell to the ground. The barbell is on the ground at chest level.For the movement grab the barbell at shoulder width grip and pull towards your chest without losing the bent over position and without moving anything but your arms","upper_back");
INSERT INTO exercies (exercise_name, exercise_discription, muscle_group) VALUES("One Arm Row","Assume a standing position while holding a dumbbell in one hand with a neutral grip. Hinge forward until your torso is roughly parallel with the floor (or slightly above) and then begin the movement by driving the elbow behind the body while retracting the shoulder blade. Pull the dumbbell towards your body until the elbow is at (or just past) the midline and then slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position under control. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions on both sides.","upper_back");
INSERT INTO exercies (exercise_name, exercise_discription, muscle_group) VALUES("Reverse Flyes"," When lying face down and using dumbbells, a person holds a dumbbell in each hand. With your elbows slightly bent, slowly lift the weights to where the hands reach shoulder level or a little before shoulder level. You should feel tension or a pinch in the upper back when you have reached the shoulder position. Then, lower the weights back to the floor. If you perform this exercise while upright, lift from the waist, then lift the barbells from the waist level backward (a typical fly moves the weights forward).","upper_back");

Grasp the bar with a neutral grip (palms facing in). Keeping your legs slightly bent and your back straight, pull the weight up slightly off the stack. You should be sitting straight upright with your shoulders back. This is the starting position. Keeping your body in position, pull the handle into your stomach. Pull your shoulder blades back, squeeze, pause, and then slowly lower the weight back to the starting position. Repeat for desired reps.","upper_back");
